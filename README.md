## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

"This was my first project working with HTML and CSS. I learned :
- how to properly structure HTML documents, 
- apply styles to elements, 
- use flexbox to center elements on the page."


### Continued development

"I would like to continue working with Flexbox and CSS Grid in future projects.



### Useful resources

- [flexboxfroggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) - With this game, I learned how to use Flexbox to create dynamic and responsive layouts. It was a valuable learning experience, and I look forward to incorporating this knowledge into future projects.
